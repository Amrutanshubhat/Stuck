KYC is a process which involves Identifying and, in certain circumstances, Validating or Verifying
various details about the Bank’s Clients. The Bank has established the KYC End to End Process as
a framework to:
 Better understand its Clients and the overall risk profile attached to its Client base;
 Identify and manage its financial crime risks;
 Document the work performed to establish the acceptability of the Bank’s Clients in a clear
manner, enabling the Bank to demonstrate that it has met its regulatory obligations; and
 Promote high ethical and professional standards.
The foundation of the Bank’s KYC Framework is the application of a risk-based approach towards Due
Diligence undertaken on each Client. Due Diligence is the process through which the Clients are
Identified, and the level and frequency of Due Di l igence performed should be driven by the
inherent f inancial crime r isk of the Client Relationship (provided those risks fall within the Bank’s
risk appetite).
Accordingly, the level of Due Diligence to be performed differs depending on the Client Risk Rating,
which is determined during the initial assessment. For more information, refer to the Determining
Client Risk Rating and Due Diligence Level Chapter. There are two categories of Due Diligence:
 Client Due Diligence (CDD); and
 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).
